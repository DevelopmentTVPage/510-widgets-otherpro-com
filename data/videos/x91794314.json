        "description": "We all have something to cover. \nLet's TAKE IT OFF. Together.\nWHAT'S YOUR CAMO CONFESSION?\n\nWe all have something to cover. In fact 60% of Americans have a skin concern that they would consider camouflaging with cosmetics. Today, Dermablend\u00ae Professional dares you to take it off and reveal your camouflage through Camo Confessions, a YouTube initiative that empowers and enables men and women who have overcome skin related obstacles to \u201cblend in to stand out\u201d. This uplifting campaign reveals the intimate confessions of how people have used Dermablend cosmetics to \u201cblend in\u201d, camouflaging their imperfections or tattoos and thus allowing them to \u201cstand out\u201d for who they are and not for their skin concern.\n \n \nDermablend launches the campaign by collaborating with three influencers who will have you captivated by the reveal of what they have camouflaged; however, it is their inner confidence and proven successes that make you look past their imperfections and celebrate their accomplishments\n\nDermablend encourages people to get involved and share their confession to inspire others!\n \nSkin does not reflect who you are on the inside. Don\u2019t let other people\u2019s judgments get in your way. Be bold and reach your goals!\n \nCreated by an American dermatologist, Dermablend Professional has been recognized as the expert in camouflage cosmetics since 1981. Today, Dermablend is the #1 dermatologist recommended camouflage brand. Whatever your coverage need, camouflage it flawlessly with Dermablend.",
